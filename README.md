During the Google Cyber Security course, I learned many new English terms related to information security. One important word was "vulnerability", which refers to a weakness in a system that can be exploited by attackers. I also learned the term "firewall", a security system that helps protect networks from unauthorized access. Another useful term was "encryption", which means converting data into a secret code to prevent unauthorized access. Additionally, I became familiar with "phishing", a common cyber attack where attackers trick users into giving personal information. These new words have helped me understand cybersecurity concepts more clearly and communicate more effectively in English when discussing online safety.
